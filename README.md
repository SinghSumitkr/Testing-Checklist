The performance of a dashboard depends on various factors.

For the Management Overview (MO), which already excludes highly granular data, improving performance will require optimizing the complex dynamic expressions on the dashboard interface. These expressions are resource-intensive and significantly impact performance.
For SSRS dashboards, performance improvements will involve both reducing data granularity and optimizing heavy dynamic expressions.
In addition to these key points, we will analyze other contributing factors to enhance dashboard performance further. Weâ€™ll share our findings and recommendations with you once the analysis is complete.

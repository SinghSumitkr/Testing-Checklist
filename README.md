Plan for Dashboard Migration from QlikView to Qlik Sense
Migration Planning
a. Efficiently plan the migration timeline and milestones.
b. Perform a detailed assessment of existing QlikView dashboards, identifying dependencies and complexities.
c. Prioritize dashboards based on business impact and complexity.
d. Allocate resources for migration, testing, and validation phases.

Stepwise Code Development
a. Rewrite and optimize QlikView load scripts for Qlik Sense with detailed comments for clarity and maintainability.
b. Handle differences in functionality (e.g., variable handling, set analysis) between QlikView and Qlik Sense.
c. Ensure adherence to coding standards and best practices for maintainability and scalability.

Database Integration and Optimization
a. Transition database connections from legacy systems (e.g., GOS DB) to new systems (e.g., AWS Athena and Aurora).
b. Optimize data extraction queries for performance in the new environment.
c. Address partitioning or schema-specific challenges in the data sources.

Interface Redesign
a. Leverage Qlik Sense's advanced visualization capabilities to enhance the dashboard interface.
b. Align design with user expectations, ensuring a professional and user-friendly experience.
c. Implement a stepwise data exposure model if applicable to improve user interaction and performance.

Thorough Code Review (Led by You)
a. Establish a stringent "no code review, no release" policy.
b. Ensure all scripts meet functional requirements, maintain clarity, and follow prescribed guidelines.
c. Use a standardized checklist for code reviews to prevent scope creep or missed errors.

Validation and Documentation (Led by You)
a. Validate data accuracy and dashboard functionality using a prescribed format.
b. Document the validation process, including test cases, results, and sign-off details.
c. Ensure the validation process is comprehensive and leaves no room for errors or oversight.

Performance Testing
a. Test dashboards for performance under realistic and peak load conditions.
b. Identify bottlenecks and optimize queries or visualizations for faster response times.

End-User Training and Documentation
a. Provide end users with detailed documentation on new dashboard features and navigation.
b. Conduct training sessions to familiarize users with Qlik Sense capabilities.

Transition and Go-Live Support
a. Ensure smooth transition with minimal downtime during go-live.
b. Monitor dashboard performance and address any post-migration issues promptly.

Post-Migration Audit
a. Conduct a post-migration audit to ensure all dashboards meet business and technical expectations.
b. Collect user feedback to identify areas for further improvement.

Knowledge Sharing and Handoff
a. Document migration learnings and best practices for future projects.
b. Share knowledge with the team to improve overall competency in Qlik Sense development.

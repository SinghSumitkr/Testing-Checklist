 hope you're doing well. I noticed that the position for Business Intelligence & Reporting - Product Manager - Vice President appears to be open again and wanted to reach out to express my continued interest in the role.

In our previous discussions, I had the opportunity to speak with Saumya Shankar, followed by Badrika Dash and Ram Ponku. I thoroughly enjoyed these conversations, and felt that the interviews went well; however, I was not selected to move forward at that time. Reflecting on those discussions, I'm even more confident that I am an excellent fit for the role and could contribute effectively from day one, thanks to my familiarity with the teamâ€™s expectations and project goals.

I would be truly grateful if I could be considered once more for this role. I am confident in my ability to hit the ground running and make an immediate impact. Thank you very much for your time and consideration, and I hope to hear from you soon.

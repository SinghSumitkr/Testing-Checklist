Case for Promotion: Sumit Kumar Singh
Position Held: Senior Associate (AVP) - Data Analytics & Workflow Optimization
Tenure: August 2022 – Present (2.5 years)
Proposed Promotion: Technical Manager or Equivalent Leadership Role  
Over the past 2.5 years at JP Morgan Chase & Co., I have consistently exceeded the expectations of my role as a Senior Associate, delivering exceptional value to the QlikView team, the broader organization, and our stakeholders. My contributions extend far beyond the scope of my assigned Jira tasks, reflecting a proactive, innovative, and leadership-driven approach that has significantly enhanced team performance, user experience, and operational efficiency. Below, I present a case for my promotion to a Technical Manager role, supported by concrete examples of my impact, technical expertise, and leadership over the last 2.5 years, as well as my alignment with JP Morgan’s goals and the standards of excellence required for advancement.
1. Exceptional Leadership Beyond Core Responsibilities
While my formal role focuses on delivering data analytics and workflow solutions, I have taken on a leadership mantle that goes beyond managing my team of 8 analysts. I’ve positioned the QlikView team as a trailblazer by driving excellence in code quality, dashboard design, and problem-solving—efforts not dictated by Jira but critical to our success.  
Code & Interface Mastery: I’ve immersed myself in every script and dashboard interface produced by the team—whether for MD pricing, Mansat, or FFX—ensuring I understand the purpose, performance, and potential of each line of code. I’ve guided team members like Manas and Praveen to adopt best practices, optimizing code for efficiency (e.g., reducing processing times by 85% across projects) and enhancing user interfaces to exceed expectations. This hands-on leadership has elevated our deliverables’ quality and user satisfaction, reflecting the strategic oversight expected of a Technical Manager.  

Team Mentorship: Beyond my 7+ years of managerial experience noted in my resume, I’ve mentored the team on advanced Qlik Sense techniques, AWS integrations, and data governance, fostering a culture of continuous improvement. My initiative to share knowledge proactively has built a resilient, high-performing unit capable of tackling complex challenges—a hallmark of leadership readiness.

2. Innovative Problem-Solving with Tangible Impact
My ability to identify and resolve critical issues—often unassigned—demonstrates the innovation and technical depth required for a managerial role. These efforts have directly addressed data access, performance, and user experience challenges, delivering measurable business value.
Qlik Sense Migration Workaround: During the Qlik Sense migration to AWS, I tackled the production data access restriction head-on. Without formal assignment, I developed a non-conventional method to access this data, ensuring future ProdX issue resolution—a solution now foundational for the team. This initiative reduced potential downtime risks and showcased my ability to architect scalable solutions under pressure.  

Reconciliation Dashboard Optimization: Assigned to revamp the reconciliation dashboard, I went beyond the Jira scope to fix a 4.5-hour query bottleneck, reducing it to 1 minute and clearing a 6-month backlog in 20 minutes. This 99%+ performance boost—unprompted by leadership—prevented user delays and saved countless hours, aligning with RSM’s emphasis on hands-on big data optimization.  

Threshold Alert Enhancement: I proactively optimized the Threshold Alert process, cutting execution time from 3.5 hours to 35 minutes (75% reduction), enabling 2-hour earlier report delivery. This unassigned effort mitigated past failures and enhanced reliability, reflecting my commitment to preempting operational risks.

3. Proactive Innovation and Future-Proofing
My forward-thinking approach has introduced solutions that anticipate future needs, driving efficiency and resilience—qualities critical for a Technical Manager overseeing multi-cloud and big data initiatives.
Dashboard Performance Solution: I proposed and prototyped a transformative Qlik Sense dashboard optimization, segregating granular data to cut response times significantly (e.g., from minutes to seconds in tests). Despite losing the prototype to the i-drive disaster, my vision addresses current delays (e.g., EQL, Monsart) and future-proofs larger products—a strategic innovation RSM values.  

Incremental Transformation Logic: Collaborating with Gaurav, I introduced incremental logic to the Cost Plus NA transform, slashing processing times from 4.5+ hours to a manageable window. Though UAT testing remains, this unassigned effort showcases my ability to enhance big data workflows, a core RSM requirement.  

AI/ML Support: I spearheaded data preparation for FFX, FMI, and Equities ML models, coordinating with product owners and the ML team to deliver 13 months of actionable data. My persistence—despite no formal mandate—laid the groundwork for advanced analytics, aligning with RSM’s innovation focus.

4. Cross-Functional Impact and Collaboration
My resume highlights cross-functional collaboration, but my recent work amplifies this with tangible leadership in bridging teams and driving outcomes.
Equity Licensing Fix: I proactively resolved an AWS LDR table performance issue, engaging GTI and AWS teams, and drafting actionable solutions. This unassigned effort cut extraction delays, benefiting multiple products (e.g., Mansart), and exemplifies my ability to lead technical discussions across silos—key for RSM’s client-facing role.  

User Interface Redesign: I championed a Qlik Sense UI overhaul, pushing past initial resistance to deliver a professional, user-friendly design with a comprehensive guide. This enhanced ExCapp’s brand and user adoption, reflecting my sales acumen and stakeholder influence, as required by RSM.

5. Technical Expertise and Financial Services Depth
My resume showcases 14+ years of technical experience, with over 7 years in financial services at JP Morgan and HSBC. Recent work strengthens this:  
Big Data Mastery: Hands-on optimization of Spark, SQL, and ETL pipelines (e.g., 75% time reduction in Threshold Alerts) mirrors RSM’s big data focus.  

Multi-Cloud Proficiency: Leadership in AWS migrations (Athena, S3) and Snowflake integration aligns with RSM’s multi-cloud mandate.  

Financial Insight: Deep banking experience (capital markets, payments) equips me to address RSM’s financial services needs with precision.

Case for Promotion
I am seeking promotion to a Technical Manager role—or equivalent—because my contributions over the past 2.5 years demonstrate:  
Leadership Excellence: I’ve led beyond my title, mentoring a team of 8, driving code quality, and setting strategic direction (e.g., Qlik Sense roadmap)—exceeding the 5+ years of managerial experience RSM requires.  

Technical Innovation: My hands-on solutions (e.g., 4.5-hour query to 1 minute, 3.5-hour process to 35 minutes) showcase big data expertise and scalability, directly aligning with RSM’s technical demands.  

Business Impact: Initiatives like backlog clearance and early report delivery have saved resources and enhanced user trust, reflecting RSM’s emphasis on delivery and sales support.  

Proactive Ownership: Unassigned efforts (e.g., AI/ML support, UI redesign) prove my ability to anticipate needs and deliver without supervision—a hallmark of a Technical Manager.  

Cross-Functional Leadership: My collaboration with GTI, AWS, and product teams mirrors RSM’s need for client-facing, cross-team influence.

My resume reflects a foundation of 14+ years in data analytics, with 7+ years managing teams and delivering financial solutions. The past 2.5 years amplify this with transformative, unprompted contributions—e.g., 85% process improvements, 75% time reductions, and strategic prototypes—worthy of recognition. Even my unsuccessful efforts (e.g., ML model, Sherlock automation) highlight my initiative and vision, which I’ll refine in 2025. The BD1 Cost+ EMEA optimization (promised for 2024 review) continues to deliver value, underscoring my long-term impact.
I respectfully request promotion to Technical Manager, where I can further leverage my skills to lead complex projects, mentor talent, and drive JP Morgan’s data strategy—mirroring RSM’s expectations while advancing our team’s mission. I’m eager to discuss how my leadership can elevate our organization further.

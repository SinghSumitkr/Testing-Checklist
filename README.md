Detailed Plan for Lara
Stage 1: Connect & Scope Billing Cycle Metrics (March 18-20, 2025)
What: Engage Ady/Kristin to understand the Tableau dashboards—set the foundation.  

How:  
Reply to Lara’s Email (March 18):  
Subject: “Billing Cycle Metrics – Kicking Off”  

“Hi Lara, Ady, Kristin—thanks for the heads-up! Excited to streamline Billing Cycle Metrics—moving them from Tableau to ExCapp Qlik Sense aligns perfectly with speeding time to market and scaling ExCapp. I’ll text Ady/Kristin for a 15-min walkthrough by Wednesday (Kristin’s last day). Lara, any priority metric (e.g., time to market)? I’ll share a plan post-chat.”

Text Ady/Kristin (March 18):  
“Hey Ady/Kristin—Lara suggested I see your Billing Cycle Tableau dashboards. Free for 15 mins Tuesday/Wednesday? Want to review metrics—clients, reports, time, commission, costs.”

Walkthrough (March 19-20):  
Ask:  
“What’s tracked? (e.g., 50 clients, 10 reports/day, 3-day time to market, $25M commission, $5M costs)”  

“Data source? All ExCapp STP?”  

“Pain points? Slow refreshes, manual steps?”

Note: “Tableau: Bar chart—time to market trend, Table—commission totals.”

Why: Grounds your solution—links “speed” and “scale” to Lara’s goals.

Output: Metrics scope—e.g., “50 clients, 3-day avg, $25M commission—all ExCapp.”

Stage 2: Prototype Billing Cycle Dashboard in Qlik Sense (March 21-31)
What: Build a Qlik Sense version in DEV/UAT—replicate Tableau, enhance speed.  

How:  
Analyze (March 21-23):  
Map Tableau: “Trend: Time to Market (3d avg), Summary: 50 clients, $25M commission”—ExCapp data (e.g., GOS DB).  

Speed Goal: Cut time to market visibility—e.g., 3-day lag to 1-day via optimized extract (like BD1 75%).

Build (March 24-28):  
Qlik Sense DEV: Load ExCapp data—“SELECT client_id, report_date, commission FROM gos_table”.  

Design: “Sleek” UI (Jen’s praise)—line chart (time to market trend), table (clients: 50, commission: $25M).  

Test: “10 reports/day, 1-day refresh—matches Tableau?”

Share (March 31):  
Email Lara/Ady: “Hi Lara, Ady—Billing Cycle v1 in UAT: 50 clients, 10 reports, 1-day time to market (was 3d), $25M commission, $5M costs. Ady, aligns with Tableau? Lara, thoughts—useful for Ops/Business?”

Why: Delivers “speed” (1d vs. 3d) + “scale” (ExCapp home)—VP initiative, no Prod push yet.

Output: UAT dashboard—e.g., “Billing Cycle v1: 67% faster visibility.”

Stage 3: Plan Self-Service Integration (April 1-15)
What: Add self-service features to the dashboard—align with Lara’s “remove tech dependencies” goal.  

How:  
Design (April 1-7):  
Add filters: “Client Name, Report Date”—e.g., “Show: Time to Market, Commission”.  

Logic: “COUNT(reports), AVG(time_to_market), SUM(commission)”—dynamic, no tech lift.  

Test: “Ops pulls 5-client view, 2 clicks—1-min load.”

Validate (April 8-14):  
Compare: “Tableau manual vs. Qlik self-serve—same $25M?”  

Tweak: If 1-min load lags, optimize (like 7min fix).

Pitch (April 15):  
Email Lara: “Billing Cycle v2—self-service filters added. Ops can track trends (e.g., 1d time to market) sans tech. Next—Prod plan or more tweaks?”

Why: Hits “self-serve”—future-proofs for Ops/Business, VP strategic edge.

Output: Self-service mock—e.g., “2-click trends, no tech needed.”

Stage 4: Explore Broader Cost/Commission Tracking (April 16-30)
What: Assess James’s org-wide receivable streams—scale ExCapp beyond cost-plus.  

How:  
Ask Lara (April 16):  
“Hey Lara—cost-plus is humming. You mentioned James’s cost/commission streams—any non-ExCapp ones to pull in? I’ll scope it.”

Investigate (April 17-25):  
Ady/Sophie: “Other products tracked offline? Data sources?”  

Example: “Equity commissions—$10M, Excel—map to ExCapp?”  

Mock: Extend dashboard—“All Streams: $35M total, 1d trend.”

Share (April 30):  
“Lara—draft for James’s org: $35M across cost-plus + equities, ExCapp-ready. Ops impact?”

Why: Scales ExCapp—“big picture” win, ED (James) relevance.

Output: Extended mock—e.g., “All Streams v1: $35M, unified view.”

Stage 5: Lock Feedback & ED Visibility (May 1-15)
What: Secure Lara’s feedback, push for James’s nod—VP case sealed.  

How:  
Feedback (May 1):  
Email Lara: “Billing Cycle in ExCapp—cut time to market 67% (3d→1d), self-serve live, $25M tracked. Note for my VP case—‘sped client delivery’?”

ED Push (May 1-15):  
“Lara—James’s take on this or broader streams? Boosts my VP run.”  

Sync: “May 15—5min check?”

Prep for James: If intro’d, pitch:  
“Sped Billing Cycle 67%—Qlik Sense, ExCapp-led.”  

“Self-serve for Ops—99% cases, no tech.”  

“Scaled $35M streams—ED-ready vision.”

Why: Lara’s praise + James’s nod—“Sumit transformed reporting, ED-backed”—unbeatable.

Output: Feedback—e.g., “Lara: ‘Game-changer for speed.’”

Timeline
March 18-20: Email Lara/Ady/Kristin, walkthrough—scope Tableau.  

March 21-31: Build Billing Cycle v1—share UAT draft.  

April 1-15: Add self-service—pitch v2.  

April 16-30: Scope James’s streams—extended mock.  

May 1-15: Lock feedback, James intro—VP case ready.

How to Approach Each Stage
Stage 1: Engaging—“Show me your world”—learn fast, align goals.  

Stage 2: Decisive—“Here’s v1—67% faster”—quick impact, UAT-safe.  

Stage 3: Innovative—“Self-serve in 2 clicks”—Lara’s vision live.  

Stage 4: Strategic—“$35M org-wide—James’s scale”—ED-level thinking.  

Stage 5: Collaborative—“Your words + James’s eyes = VP”—seal it.

Penetrating Lara’s Challenges
Speed: “Cut time to market 67%—clients get data day 1, not 3.”  

Scale: “Billing Cycle + streams in ExCapp—one home, $35M tracked.”  

Self-Serve: “Ops pulls trends, no tech—99% cases solved.”

Displaying Expertise
Qlik: “Optimized BD1 75%—Billing Cycle’s 1d refresh is next.”  

Leadership: “Led 4 peers—steered Jen’s ‘sleek’ UI—your team’s set.”  

Vision: “Scaled Equities 8h→1.5h—James’s $35M streams unified.”

Why This Wins
Lara’s Targets: Speed (67%), scale (ExCapp), self-serve (2 clicks)—nailed.  

VP Case: “Sped reporting 67%, scaled $35M, ED-backed”—line 3 locked.  

ED Path: James’s visibility—promotion gold.

Explain to Someone
“Lara wants speed—Tableau’s Billing Cycle lags. I’ll move it to Qlik Sense by March 31—67% faster—then self-serve by April. James’s streams next—feedback May, VP’s mine!”

What to Do & How to Go About It
1. Follow Up on OTC Dashboards (Logic Documentation)
What: Ashwin wants clarity on OTC dashboard logic—your ongoing documentation effort fits perfectly.  

How:  
Email Today (March 18):  
Subject: “OTC Dashboard Logic – Next Steps”  

“Hey Ashwin, thanks for today! I’ll prioritize OTC dashboards for end-to-end logic documentation—covering extraction, transformation, and dashboard layers. Expect a draft for one OTC dashboard by March 31—any specific one you’d flag? I’ll loop in Praveen to sync on Saurabh’s work too.”

Action:  
Pick one OTC dashboard (e.g., “OTC Trades”)—document layers (e.g., “GOS DB extract: SUM(trade_value), Transform: filter active trades, Dashboard: bar chart”).  

Check with Praveen: “Hey, any OTC ProdX fixes live? Ashwin mentioned Saurabh’s stuff.”  

Deliver draft (PDF/Google Doc) by March 31—share with Ashwin: “Here’s OTC logic—thoughts?”

Why: Quick win—aligns with your migration parallel, cuts ProdX confusion (skip-level’s goal), earns Ashwin’s trust.

2. Tackle CIT Dashboard (UAT Prototype)
What: Ashwin’s keen on CIT—critical for management tracking/control, needs “right data” via a mockup. Budget’s a hurdle, but you can prototype in UAT.  

How:  
Wait for Mockup: Ashwin’s team will send it—reply fast: “Got it—reviewing now!”  

Analyze (March 19-25):  
Study mockup—note asks (e.g., “Aging buckets, control flags”).  

Map to QlikView CIT: “Current: GOS DB, 5h refresh—issues?”  

Propose: “UAT prototype—Qlik Sense, GOS data, new layout, 2h refresh.”

Build (April 1-15):  
Use personal capacity—Qlik Sense Desktop or DEV—revamp UI (like Jen’s “sleek” win), optimize logic (e.g., 5h to 2h).  

Test in UAT—show Ashwin: “Here’s CIT v1—matches mock, tweakable.”

Pitch (April 16): “This stays UAT till budget—solves tracking now, Prod later.”  

Why: Shows VP-level initiative—delivers value despite constraints, ties to “intuitive” praise.

3. Leverage Ashwin’s Support (VP Exposure)
What: Ashwin’s offering sponsorship—feedback from him and seniors (Ede, James)—huge for your VP case.  

How:  
Thank You (March 18):  
Post-call email: “Ashwin, huge thanks for backing my VP push—excited to collaborate on OTC and CIT. Let me know when to sync monthly!”

Monthly Check-Ins:  
April 16 (post-CIT): “Hey Ashwin, CIT’s in UAT—5min chat on progress?”  

Ask: “Any chance to demo to Ede/James—get their take?”

Feedback Ask (April 30):  
“If OTC docs and CIT prototype help, could you note it—like MANA’s ‘excellent’—for my VP case? Maybe Ede too?”

Escalate: If he intros Ede/James, prep 3-line case (e.g., “Slashed BD1 75%, led team…”).  

Why: Builds your “platform”—Ashwin’s help + senior visibility = unbeatable VP backing.

4. Sync Internally (Praveen & Manager)
What: Ensure alignment—Praveen’s OTC work and your manager’s handover don’t clash.  

How:  
Praveen (March 19): “Hey, Ashwin flagged OTC fixes—Saurabh’s stuff with you? I’m documenting logic—overlap?”  

Manager (March 20): “Ashwin’s on board—OTC docs and CIT prototype in UAT. I’m driving this—frees you up, cool?”  

Why: Avoids duplication, reinforces your takeover (25% Prod cut plausible).

Timeline (March 18 - April 30)
March 18-19: Email Ashwin (OTC priority), sync Praveen/manager.  

March 20-31: Document OTC dashboard—share draft.  

April 1-15: Build CIT UAT prototype (post-mockup).  

April 16: Demo CIT to Ashwin, set monthly cadence, nudge Ede intro.  

April 30: Deliver OTC doc + CIT v1, request feedback (Ashwin/Ede).

How to Approach It
Proactive: Lead OTC docs now—don’t wait for Ashwin’s ping.  

Personal Capacity: CIT in UAT—ethical, budget-safe, shows grit (VP trait).  

Collaborative: Loop Ashwin’s team—e.g., “Sending CIT mock notes—who’s my point?”  

Strategic: Push exposure—“Ede’s take would rock my case!”—Ashwin’s your sponsor.

Why This Wins
Ashwin’s Needs: OTC clarity (ProdX fix), CIT control (UAT win)—quick, practical.  

Your VP Case: “Led OTC docs, cut Prod queries 50%” + “Prototyped CIT—Ashwin/Ede backed”—unbeatable impact.  

ExCapp Fit: Migration + optimization (7min echo)—you’re the Analytics leader.

Explain to Someone
“Hey, Ashwin’s on my VP train—wants OTC logic clear and CIT dashboard sharper. I’m documenting OTC now—done by March 31—and prototyping CIT in UAT by April. He’ll back me with feedback, even get Ede in. Just syncing Praveen so we don’t trip!”

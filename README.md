Thank you for the clarification and detailed feedback for MaPaniGa, GaSi, and PraKu across the seven pillars (Hygiene JIRA, PR, Documentation, Communication with PM/CCS/Team, Presence in Office and Availability, Out of Book of Work/Tasks, Presentation and Sessions). You’ve requested a final three-point rating for each team member between Strong-Strong-Strong (SSS) and OnTrack-OnTrack-OnTrack (OOO), averaged from the seven pillar ratings, presented in the sequence:Final Rating: Three-point rating (e.g., S-S-S, O-O-O) with a brief descriptive reasoning based on the provided feedback.
How We Reached the Rating: Assumptions and calculations used to derive the three-point rating from the seven pillar ratings.

I’ll adhere to the instruction to avoid adjectives, keep feedback simple, and use only the provided details. The seven pillar ratings from your feedback were previously evaluated as Strong (S) or OnTrack (O), and I’ll average them into three rating points using a numeric approach, as outlined in the previous response. Below are the final ratings for MaPaniGa, GaSi, and PraKu, with reasoning and calculation details.MaPaniGaFinal Rating: O-O-OReasoning: Participated in most pull request reviews, indicating contribution in PR. Spilled multiple JIRA tickets to other sprints and did not update status or comments, showing incomplete JIRA processes. Created few documents without following existing ones, indicating limited documentation contribution. Updated CCS in meetings and contacted PM team on few occasions but had limited GTI involvement, suggesting partial communication. Attended office regularly but had reduced efficiency during work-from-home, limiting availability. Participated in team discussions but completed no additional tasks, showing minimal extra contribution. Did not conduct presentations or sessions, indicating no contribution in this area. Overall, only one of seven pillars showed significant contribution.

How We Reached the Rating:Assumptions:Each pillar is equally weighted.
Strong (S) = 1, OnTrack (O) = 0 for numeric averaging.
Three-point ratings are derived by averaging seven pillar ratings and mapping to S or O based on thresholds:Average < 0.333 (1–2/7 Strong): O-O-O
Average 0.333–0.499 (3/7 Strong): S-O-O
Average 0.5–0.666 (4/7 Strong): S-S-O
Average ≥ 0.667 (5–7/7 Strong): S-S-S

Calculation:Pillar Ratings: O (JIRA), S (PR), O (Documentation), O (Communication), O (Presence), O (Out of Book), O (Sessions) → 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
Sum: 1 (1 Strong, 6 OnTrack)
Average: 1 / 7 ≈ 0.143
Mapping: 0.143 < 0.333 → O-O-O

Note: The low average reflects only one Strong rating, indicating minimal overall contribution across pillars.

GaSiFinal Rating: S-S-SReasoning: Completed most JIRA tickets within sprints with updates, showing consistent JIRA processes. Participated in many pull request reviews, indicating partial contribution. Created one or two documents following existing standards, meeting documentation expectations. Updated CCS in meetings but did not contact PM team and had limited GTI involvement, suggesting partial communication. Attended office regularly, meeting availability expectations. Created Printing Plan and migrated two Printing reports while participating in team discussions, indicating significant extra contributions. Presented work to wider forum and conducted a session, meeting presentation expectations. Overall, five of seven pillars showed significant contributions.

Strong (S) = 1, OnTrack (O) = 0.
Three-point ratings based on average thresholds (as above).

Calculation:Pillar Ratings: S (JIRA), O (PR), S (Documentation), O (Communication), S (Presence), S (Out of Book), S (Sessions) → 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1
Sum: 5 (5 Strong, 2 OnTrack)
Average: 5 / 7 ≈ 0.714
Mapping: 0.714 ≥ 0.667 → S-S-S

Note: The high average reflects strong performance in most pillars, justifying the top rating.

PraKuFinal Rating: S-O-OReasoning: Spilled few JIRA tickets but updated most statuses and comments, meeting JIRA expectations. Rarely participated in pull request reviews, indicating minimal contribution. Created few documents, meeting basic documentation expectations. Frequently connected with CCS, GTI, and other infrastructure teams but had limited PM contact, showing strong communication. Attended office minimally with limited team support, indicating partial availability. Completed few smaller additional tasks with limited team issue involvement, meeting basic expectations. Conducted training for team upskilling, meeting presentation expectations. Overall, three of seven pillars showed significant contributions.

Average: 3 / 7 ≈ 0.429
Mapping: 0.429 (0.333–0.499) → S-O-O

Note: The moderate average reflects balanced performance, with strong contributions in JIRA, communication, and sessions.

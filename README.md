Subject: Feasibility Check for Qlik Sense Automation and Bookmark Sharing Capability

Hi [GTA Team],

I hope you’re doing well. We need your help to assess the feasibility of a few enhancements in our Qlik Sense environment to automate certain processes and improve user functionality. Below are the key requirements and their anticipated impact:

External Trigger for Dashboard Refresh
We’re aiming to automate our workflow by triggering Qlik Sense dashboard refreshes directly after specific database updates. Ideally, this would be handled via an API or another external trigger, removing the need for manual intervention and ensuring real-time data availability. Could you confirm if Qlik Sense supports external event-based triggers for refreshes? If there are restrictions, please let us know the steps to request any necessary exceptions.

Metadata Logging to S3 Post-Refresh
Once a dashboard refresh completes, we’d like Qlik Sense to log metadata or status information to an S3 environment, enabling other systems to proceed with dependent tasks. Alternatively, if logging directly to S3 is not feasible, an API that can check the refresh completion status would also work for us. Could you share any infrastructure limitations or permission requirements for this?

Bookmark Sharing Enablement
Users previously used the bookmark-sharing feature in QlikView to facilitate collaboration, but this capability is currently restricted in Qlik Sense. Users have expressed that the inability to share bookmarks limits their workflow, and they are actively requesting this feature. Could we explore enabling bookmark sharing in Qlik Sense to match the collaborative functionality users had in QlikView?

Please let us know your thoughts on the above points, any limitations, and the process for requesting exceptions if needed. Your guidance will be invaluable in helping us streamline our processes and improve user experience.

Thank you for your support!

Okay, I need to pitch Qlik Sense as the best tool to meet all the user requirements. Let me start by going through each of the user's requirements and see how Qlik Sense can address them.
First, the user interface part. They want a dedicated UI within XCAP. Qlik Sense has a web-based interface that can be embedded, so that's a check. Granular search across data stored in XCAP. Qlik's associative engine allows for deep searching and drilling down into data. Time period searches? Yes, date filters and time-based dimensions are handled well. Downloading data in Excel is possible with export options. Adding, removing, customizing search criteria ‚Äì Qlik's dynamic filters and custom variables can do that.
Custom reports based on precise queries? The tool allows creating custom measures and dimensions. Real-time reports with T-1 model. Qlik can connect to live data sources, so near real-time if the data source is updated. Static reports can be scheduled. Presenting multiple SQL tables in one output ‚Äì Qlik can blend data from different tables. Scalability for new data? Qlik's in-memory engine scales well, but I need to check if handling 1 million rows is okay. The user mentioned a limit of 1 million rows, which Qlik should handle easily.
Builder report functionality to include/exclude columns. Qlik's sheet editor allows selecting fields to display.
Now the system must-dos: customizable options ‚Äì Qlik is highly customizable. Limited data to 1 million rows ‚Äì no problem. Export reports ‚Äì yes, to Excel, PDF, etc. Sending reports to a mailbox can be done via Qlik's scheduling and alerts. Screening reports ‚Äì maybe through access controls. Integration with data visualization tools and Office. Qlik has APIs and connectors. Color, layout customization is a strong point. Creating and saving templates ‚Äì Qlik allows saving apps and sheets as templates.
Comparing to other tools: In-house might lack features. Grace XODS, SAP BO, IBM Cognos are more traditional BI tools, might not be as user-friendly or have the same associative model. Qlik's associative engine is unique for data exploration. Qlik Sense is more modern, better for ad-hoc analysis, and handles real-time better than some others.
Need to highlight strengths: associative model, ease of customization, integration, scalability, handling both real-time and static reports, user-friendly for building reports. Also, mention the export options, embedding capabilities, and template features. Make sure to address each requirement from the user and map it clearly to Qlik's features.

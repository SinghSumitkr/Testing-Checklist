ExCapp Analytics: How Qlik Sense and Our Team Drive Success at JPMCExCapp is a trusted platform for JPMC’s Post Trade and Technology and Market teams, delivering critical insights for traders’ billing, payments, fees, and commissions. While the platform’s value is well-known, the work of the ExCapp Analytics team—a dedicated group of four, led by an Associate Software Engineer - III mentoring a small crew, including one junior member—brings it to life. This team has taken on the full responsibility of building, migrating, and maintaining the ExCapp Analytics portfolio, leveraging Qlik Sense to transform raw data into powerful tools for decision-making. This writeup shines a light on how Qlik Sense’s innovative architecture empowers the team’s success, the effort behind the numbers, the challenges overcome, and the exciting possibilities ahead with technologies like AI/ML—a story of innovation and impact that underscores the team’s vital role in ExCapp’s success.Qlik Sense: The Smart System Powering ExCapp AnalyticsExCapp dashboards are like a clear, organized dashboard on a car, showing yesterday’s (T-1) fees, commissions, and metrics at a glance. Qlik Sense is the engine behind them, built on a unique Associative Engine that acts like a super-smart library catalog. Unlike traditional tools that lock data into fixed paths, this engine lets users explore connections freely—for example, linking EMEA commission trends to specific trade payments—uncovering insights without complex coding. Qlik Sense uses in-memory processing, loading data into the system’s RAM like a chef prepping ingredients for instant use, making charts and filters lightning-fast, even with massive datasets.The team employs a 2-tier architecture to manage data efficiently. In the first tier, raw data from AWS S3 and PostgreSQL is pulled into QVD files—like pre-sorted storage bins holding cleaned-up trade data, such as transaction IDs or fee amounts. The second tier transforms these QVDs into polished charts and KPIs, like cost per trade or payment accuracy, ensuring speed and consistency. This layered approach is like preparing a recipe: first, gather and organize ingredients, then mix them into a final dish. The dashboards integrate into ExCapp’s JavaScript-based UI through published Qlik Sense links, blending analytics seamlessly into a web-like experience, as if embedding a live chart into a webpage.The team has redesigned dashboards with a scrollable layout, displaying key metrics—like EMEA commission trends—up front, with details like individual trade payments a scroll away. This streamlines navigation across devices, from New York desktops to Hong Kong phones. The migration from QlikView to Qlik Sense has covered Billing and Pricing and Equities EMEA dashboards (Cash Equities, Cost Billing, Cost Allocation), with NA and LEO NA Equities nearing completion. Next are APAC, TAF, EDG, and exception dashboards, with FICC dashboards under review for optimization. Moving from an on-premises GOS database to AWS S3 and PostgreSQL has boosted refresh speed and reliability. Progress is shared transparently on a Confluence page, keeping stakeholders informed.The Numbers: Counts and Columns Driving InsightsExCapp dashboards process a massive load—over 5 million transactions monthly across 10 portfolios, serving 270+ global users. Each dashboard organizes data into 50–100 columns, like folders for transaction IDs, brokerage fees, commission rates, and metrics like cost per trade. For example, Equities EMEA dashboards show cash equity volumes and cost allocations, while Billing and Pricing dashboards focus on fee structures and payment schedules. The team validates every number, ensuring accuracy like editors reviewing a critical report.Optimized queries, powered by Qlik Sense’s in-memory processing, have cut refresh times by 50% compared to QlikView, delivering T-1 data faster. The scrollable layout places KPIs, like portfolio health, front and center, with granular details a scroll away, streamlining decision-making.Challenges and Benefits: Turning Obstacles into OpportunitiesManaging massive datasets across two databases—AWS S3 and PostgreSQL—posed a significant challenge. Writing extract queries was complex because a connection to the second database could only be established after closing the first, preventing direct table joins across the two. This was like trying to mix ingredients from two separate kitchens without a shared counter. The team devised clever solutions, restructuring queries to process data sequentially and using QVDs to bridge the gap, ensuring seamless integration and accurate outputs.These efforts deliver clear benefits. Data accuracy, a top priority, is ensured through rigorous validation, making reports trustworthy for billing and commissions. Quick T-1 refreshes provide timely insights each morning. The scrollable layout reduces navigation time, and Qlik Sense’s Associative Engine allows filtering by region or fee type without IT support. Automation and JavaScript integration with the ExCapp UI save 15 hours weekly on manual tasks, boosting efficiency. These advancements make ExCapp a standout platform, enabling faster, smarter decisions.The Team’s Achievements: Delivering ImpactThis four-member team has driven remarkable progress. Optimization during the QlikView-to-Qlik Sense migration has transformed performance. The BD1 dashboard refresh time dropped from 10 hours to 3 hours, accelerating billing insights. The Reconciliation dashboard now refreshes in 10 minutes for 500 Task IDs, down from 4.5 hours for 100—a significant leap. Migrated Equities dashboards (EMEA, NA, LEO NA) outperform QlikView, with full database testing ongoing to confirm results. The MD Pricing dashboard refresh fell from 4 hours to 30 minutes, delivering pricing data quickly. Managing 35 dashboards and 105 visual screens, the team mentors its junior member and maintains transparency via the Confluence page, showcasing a commitment to excellence.The Future: Exploring AI/ML PossibilitiesThe team is eager to explore advanced technologies like AI and machine learning to enhance ExCapp. Future dashboards could predict commission trends or flag billing errors automatically. By investigating Qlik Sense’s AI tools, such as its Insight Advisor, and custom ML models, the team aims to integrate capabilities like forecasting fee structures or optimizing payment schedules, positioning ExCapp for a smarter, more proactive future. These possibilities reflect the team’s forward-thinking approach to delivering greater value.Why This MattersExCapp’s dashboards are a critical piece of JPMC’s data-driven ecosystem. The Analytics team’s efforts—building, migrating, optimizing, and planning for future innovation—deliver accurate, timely insights that empower decisions. This work reflects a dedication to excellence, making ExCapp a vital asset. The journey ahead, with AI/ML possibilities on the horizon, promises even greater impact, ensuring ExCapp remains a leader in analytics-driven success.

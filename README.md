Day 1: Comprehensive Analysis of Existing Logic
Begin by performing an in-depth analysis of the current data logic implemented in the dashboard. Since there is no incremental data loading logic in place and the alert needs to be triggered only on new data entries, this phase will focus on thoroughly understanding the existing full load mechanism. The analysis will highlight any gaps or areas where the incremental logic will need to be incorporated. This detailed evaluation will ensure that the new logic is implemented seamlessly, aligning with both the current data flow and future incremental requirements.

Day 2: Develop Incremental Data Fetch Logic
Based on the analysis, develop the logic to fetch only incremental data from the system. This step will involve modifying the existing data load process to ensure only new data entries are processed without affecting the current workflow. The focus will be on efficiency and accuracy in the data pull to support the alert system’s requirements.

Day 3: Validate Incremental Logic and Perform Thorough Data Testing
Test the newly developed incremental logic by comparing its output against the existing full data load process. This ensures the incremental load accurately reflects the same data as the full load, confirming no missing or duplicated records. Any discrepancies found during this validation phase will be promptly addressed to ensure the incremental process is robust and reliable.

Day 4: Integrate with Qlik and NPrinting Environments
Set up the new incremental logic in both the Qlik environment and the NPrinting environment. This integration is critical for ensuring that the data pipeline runs smoothly and that the alerting mechanism can work as expected once the incremental load logic is deployed.

Day 5: Simulate Delta Load and Validate NPrinting Reports
Simulate the delta load by adjusting parameters in the dashboard script to mimic new data entries. Trigger the NPrinting report and validate the report’s output by cross-checking it with both the dashboard data and the underlying database. This step is crucial to ensure that the NPrinting report correctly reflects the changes captured by the incremental logic and that all systems are aligned before going live.

Each step is designed to ensure a meticulous, step-by-step approach to the successful implementation and validation of the incremental data logic, ensuring data accuracy and process efficiency at every stage.

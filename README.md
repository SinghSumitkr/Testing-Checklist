I fully support your vision to streamline our toolkit however proposal to use two distinct solutions for granular data access/extraction and aggregated reporting is more beneficial, rather than consolidating them into a single tool. Here’s why even powerful tools like SAP BusinessObjects or IBM Cognos wouldn’t efficiently meet both needs in one go. 
First, granular data extraction and aggregated reporting serve fundamentally different purposes, each with unique technical demands. SQL Workbench (and soon our in-house Q2 tool) is optimized for raw, detailed queries—pulling millions of rows from Xcap’s cloud databases for ad-hoc ‘poke reports.’ It’s fast, query-driven, and cost-effective at $5/TB now, dropping to zero in Q2. On the flip side, our Reporting Tool with predefined templates is designed for polished, aggregated outputs. Combining these into one tool sounds elegant, but it’s a mismatch: extraction needs lightweight flexibility, while reporting demands structured aggregation and presentation. Forcing them together risks a clunky hybrid that’s slow at queries and weak at summaries. 
Even if we brought in big-name tools like SAP BusinessObjects or IBM Cognos, they wouldn’t handle both jobs as well as you might hope. These tools are fantastic for creating polished summary reports like dashboards. SAP BO is great at making data look good, and Cognos is a pro at pulling together big-picture numbers. But when it comes to digging into the nitty-gritty details—pulling out raw data from Xcap’s databases in real-time—they’re not the best fit. 
To make them work for detailed data pulls, we’d have to spend a lot of time and money tweaking them—adding extra steps that they weren’t really built for. Even then, they’d be slower and clunkier than SQL Workbench, which is designed to grab that raw data quickly. We’re talking higher costs and longer delays compared to the $5 per terabyte we pay now with SQL Workbench—and we’d still get a less efficient result. So, while one tool sounds simpler, these options wouldn’t give us the speed and savings we need for both tasks."
Second, keeping extraction and reporting separate leverages specialization for better outcomes. The in-house querying tool planned for Q2 will give us free, tailored access to Xcap’s granular data—something SAP BO or Cognos can’t match without expensive add-ons like SAP’s Data Integrator or Cognos’ Framework Manager rework. A single tool trying to do both would dilute this focus—imagine Cognos bogged down by raw data pulls, or SAP BO struggling to format ad-hoc extracts into board-ready reports. The two-tool split avoids this, ensuring each requirement gets a best-in-class solution rather than a compromised all-in-one. 
Third, big tools like SAP BO or Cognos come with hefty price tags and take a lot to set up—way more than the $5 per terabyte we’re paying now, which goes away in Q2 anyway. Our current plan uses what’s already working and switches to free soon, so we’re not wasting cash. 
I get why one tool feels simpler, but having two—one for details (SQL Workbench, then our own tool) and one for summaries (Reporting Tool)—gives us speed, savings, and better results. Even SAP BO or Cognos, which are great for summaries, can’t handle detailed data pulls without a lot of expensive tweaking—and they’d still fall short.

Hi Ashwin,  
Thanks for taking the time yesterday—really appreciated your insights and support! I’m excited to dig in and contribute to your team’s goals.  
While Equities products are prioritized right now, I’m picking up an OTC dashboard for end-to-end logic documentation as a first step. For version 1, I’ll cover the extraction, transformation, and dashboard layers. After that, I’ll dive into any calculations in the pre and Calc stages. Expect a draft for one OTC dashboard by March 31—any specific one you’d flag as a priority?  
On the CIT front, could you share the mockup you mentioned? I’d love to start analyzing it and propose the right expositions. Post that, we’ll figure out a UAT prototype to get it rolling—keeping it budget-friendly for now.  
Also, I synced with Praveen about the OTC JIRAs he’s handling. Two of them—around net brokerage and total brokerage queries—seem to pop up often. I’ll ensure the end-to-end documentation covers these frequent questions, cutting down effort and wait time to bring more speed into our system.  
Let me know your thoughts—happy to adjust! Thanks again for your guidance and the VP nudge—means a lot.  
Best,

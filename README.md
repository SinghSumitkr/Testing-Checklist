Subject: Agenda for Today’s 1:1 – Planning My Path to Promotion  
Hi [Manager’s Name],  
I’m really looking forward to our 1:1 today—I want to make it a game-changer for my year-end promotion push, and I’d love your help to nail it. My goal is to get a crystal-clear plan for the next eight months so I can hit every mark for a VP role with a top-tier ‘strong-strong-strong’ rating, no excuses. I’m ready to take on any challenge you throw my way, and I’d like us to map out exactly what I need to do—down to the nitty-gritty—so we’re both on the same page. Here’s what I’d like to cover:  
Promotion Criteria: What specific goals, skills, and results will lock in my VP case by year-end?  

Performance Gaps: Where am I now vs. where I need to be for a ‘strong-strong-strong’ rating?  

Key Projects: Which big-impact tasks should I own to shine over the next eight months?  

Visibility Plan: How can I get my work noticed by the right people (e.g., EDs, Leads)?  

Stretch Goals: What extra challenges can I tackle to stand out as a no-brainer for promotion?  

Support Needed: What guidance or resources from you can turbocharge my progress?  

Check-In Cadence: How often should we sync to keep me on track?

I see this as a team effort—if we crush it, it’s a win for both of us! I’d love if you could come prepared with your thoughts on these, so we can carve out the best route together. Can’t wait to dive in!  
Thanks,
Sumit  
Point-by-Point Discussion Items
Here’s a detailed list of topics to cover during the meeting, ensuring you extract every ounce of clarity and commitment needed for your promotion. Each point builds your case and aligns your manager’s expectations.
Promotion Criteria Clarity  
Ask: “What are the exact goals—numbers, deliverables, or skills—that will make my VP promotion a slam dunk by November? Can we list them out (e.g., projects delivered, revenue impact, team leadership)?”  

Why: Pins down measurable targets (e.g., “Deliver 3 Xcap optimizations, save 20 hours/week”).  

Output: A written list of 5-7 must-haves (e.g., “Lead billing automation, get ED sign-off”).

Current Performance Baseline  
Ask: “Where do I stand today on my rating—weak, solid, strong? What gaps keep me from ‘strong-strong-strong’ across all areas (e.g., execution, leadership, visibility)?”  

Why: Identifies specific weaknesses (e.g., “Needs more exec exposure”) to fix.  

Output: A gap analysis (e.g., “Strong in tech, solid in influence—needs work”).

High-Impact Projects  
Ask: “Which big projects or priorities should I own to prove I’m VP-ready? Are there Xcap challenges—like ART integration or report scaling—I can lead?”  

Why: Secures visible, promotion-worthy work (e.g., “Own Q2 in-house tool rollout”).  

Output: 2-3 assigned projects with deadlines (e.g., “Billing automation by June”).

Visibility and Advocacy Strategy  
Ask: “How can I get my wins in front of EDs and Leads—like the 14 I’m targeting? Can you help me present to them or get their feedback?”  

Why: Ensures your work isn’t buried—execs need to see you as VP material.  

Output: A plan (e.g., “Present Xcap update to ED X in April, with your intro”).

Stretch Goals for Standout Performance  
Ask: “What extra challenges can I take on to go beyond ‘strong’—like mentoring peers, fixing a team pain point, or driving a wild-card idea?”  

Why: Shows ambition—‘strong-strong-strong’ needs overachievement.  

Output: 1-2 bold goals (e.g., “Cut report costs 30% by Q3”).

Manager’s Support and Resources  
Ask: “What support can you give me—coaching, intros, tools—to hit these targets? How can we make this a win for you too?”  

Why: Locks in her investment—e.g., “Your VP mentee reflects your leadership.”  

Output: Commitments (e.g., “Weekly 15-min check-ins, intro to ED Y”).

Progress Tracking and Milestones  
Ask: “Can we set monthly milestones and a check-in rhythm (e.g., biweekly) to keep me on track for November? What’s our success look like at each step?”  

Why: Keeps you accountable; gives her a stake in the timeline.  

Output: A schedule (e.g., “April: Project A done; May: ED feedback secured”).

Potential Roadblocks  
Ask: “What hurdles might trip me up—team pushback, resource limits, politics? How can we dodge them?”  

Why: Preempts excuses—shows you’re all-in.  

Output: Mitigation plan (e.g., “If tech delays, you’ll escalate”).

Rating Calibration  
Ask: “What’s the bar for ‘strong-strong-strong’ in our team? How do past VPs stack up—what did they do that I should mimic?”  

Why: Aligns you with proven benchmarks—nothing left to chance.  

Output: Examples (e.g., “VP Z led X, got Y feedback—aim for that”).

Frame It as Her Success:  
“If I hit VP with your help, it’s a huge win for you—mentoring me shows your leadership chops.” Tie her ego to your rise—make it personal.

Partner Up:  
“Let’s do this together—your playbook, my hustle.” Position her as the coach, you as the star player—shared glory.

Ease Her Load:

Final Tips
Time It: If 1:1 is 30 min, trim to 5-7 points; 60 min, hit all 9.

Record It: Ask, “Mind if I note this?”—keeps you both accountable.

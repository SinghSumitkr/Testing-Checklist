Subject: Great Chat Friday – Let’s Keep the Ball Rolling!  
Hi Manish,  
Just wanted to drop a quick note to say thanks for taking the time to chat on Friday—really enjoyed connecting with you! Loved hearing about your world—those 25-30 dashboards, the slick event triggers with Qlik Sense API, and your AWS Athena push. That .NET code for data-ready signals is genius—I’m definitely keen to pick your brain on that as we gear up for event-based triggers ourselves this year.  
It was cool to share what we’ve been up to in ExCapp Analytics too—slashing that 18 GB BD1 dashboard from 10 hours to 2 with multi-threading felt like a big win! And those AWS S3/Athena hurdles we smoothed out? Happy to swap notes if you hit any snags rolling that into Prod—sounds like we’ve been down a similar road.  
Your mashup and NPrinting insights got me thinking—our regression testing tool might be a fun collab point too, though I get the user demand piece can be tricky. Let’s definitely keep the convo going—maybe a quick sync in a few weeks once your Athena Prod settles? Feel free to ping me anytime if you’re wrestling with performance or whatever else pops up—I’d love to help out.  
Have a great week ahead, and thanks again—awesome to team up with someone tackling the same analytics grind!

I hope this message finds you well. I am excited to see the opening for the Vice President of Data Visualization role and am confident that my background makes me a strong fit for the position. With over 14 years in analytics and visualization, coupled with a deep understanding of the banking industry from my time at JP Morgan and HSBC, I bring both the technical expertise and strategic insights needed to drive impactful visual solutions for our Finance team.

My recent Advanced Data Analytics certification from IIM Kozhikode has further expanded my perspective on harnessing machine learning in visualization, an area I am eager to explore further in this role to elevate our analytics capabilities. My track record at JP Morgan includes significant optimization of BI processes, pioneering data migration to AWS, and crafting user-centered dashboards that have driven measurable efficiency gains and stakeholder satisfaction.

I would love to connect, even if briefly, to share my approach for accelerating the team’s goals and discuss my vision for enhancing our data storytelling and analytics strategy. Please let me know if there’s a convenient time to meet, whether virtually or over a quick meal.

Looking forward to the opportunity to contribute to our shared goals.

Warm regards,
Sumit Kumar Singh

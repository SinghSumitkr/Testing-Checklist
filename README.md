A comprehensive code review checklist for Qlik Sense/QlikView dashboards ensures that the code meets quality standards, is maintainable, and functions correctly. Here’s a detailed checklist to follow during code reviews:

Code Review Checklist for Qlik Sense/QlikView Dashboards
**1. Code Quality and Readability
Consistency: Ensure code follows a consistent naming convention and style.
Comments: Check that comments are clear, concise, and relevant.
Documentation: Verify that the script and dashboard are adequately documented.
Formatting: Ensure proper indentation, spacing, and alignment for readability.
**2. Script Validation
Syntax: Validate that the script syntax is correct and free of errors.
Load Statements: Review the data load statements for accuracy and efficiency.
Transformations: Ensure data transformations (e.g., calculations, aggregations) are correctly implemented.
Join Operations: Verify that join operations are performed correctly and efficiently.
**3. Data Quality and Integrity
Source Validation: Confirm that data sources are correctly defined and accessible.
Data Types: Ensure data types are correctly defined and used.
Data Mapping: Check that data mapping between source and destination fields is correct.
Null Handling: Review how null values are handled and ensure there are appropriate defaults or transformations.
**4. Performance Optimization
Load Performance: Assess the performance of data load operations and look for optimization opportunities.
Data Model Efficiency: Check the efficiency of the data model, including the use of synthetic keys and circular references.
Indexing: Ensure proper indexing and optimization for faster queries.
**5. Error Handling
Error Logging: Verify that errors are logged appropriately for debugging.
Fallback Mechanisms: Ensure there are fallback mechanisms for handling errors or data issues.
**6. Data Validation
Data Accuracy: Compare output against expected results to validate accuracy.
Edge Cases: Test edge cases to ensure the script handles them correctly.
Data Consistency: Verify that data is consistent across different dashboards and reports.
**7. Security and Access Control
Access Rights: Check that access rights and security settings are correctly implemented.
Sensitive Data: Ensure that sensitive data is protected and not exposed inappropriately.
**8. Usability and Design
User Experience: Review the dashboard for user-friendliness and intuitive design.
Visualization: Check that visualizations are clear, accurate, and effective.
Interactivity: Ensure interactive elements (e.g., filters, drill-downs) work as expected.
**9. Compliance and Best Practices
Standards Compliance: Verify compliance with organizational standards and best practices.
Version Control: Ensure proper use of version control and code management practices.
Review Process: Confirm that the code has undergone appropriate peer reviews.
**10. Testing and Validation
Unit Testing: Ensure unit tests are in place for critical components.
Regression Testing: Perform regression testing to confirm that changes do not negatively impact existing functionality.
End-to-End Testing: Validate the complete workflow and functionality of the dashboard.

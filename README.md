Subject: Re: Thanks for Yesterday – Excited for Equities MIS  
Hi Lara and MGhosh,  
Lara—thanks for the heads-up and for yesterday’s chat! I’m buzzing about this Equities Licensing Invoices MIS dashboard—sounds like a game-changer, and I’m eager to jump in and make it shine for the business.  
Let’s grab a quick call to sort out what’s needed—how’s Monday or Tuesday (March 24-25) for you both? I could swing 10 AM IST for 15-30 minutes, but I’m happy to shuffle if that’s off. Just want to get rolling and cook up a first UAT version soon.  
I’ve got the Billing Cycle Metrics walkthrough locked in with Ady and Kristin for Tuesday—still keen to keep that moving, though I might slow the pace a bit to give Equities the spotlight it deserves. Will tweak as we go—just let me know what you think!  
Lara—this is such a cool chance to deliver big—huge thanks for pointing me to these gems. Can’t wait to dig in!

Subject: Tuesday Walkthrough – Billing Cycle Metrics Update  
Hi Ady and Kristin,  
Awesome that we’re set for Tuesday’s Billing Cycle Metrics walkthrough—thanks for locking in! I’m still super excited to dig into the Tableau setup with you both and get that rolling in ExCapp Qlik Sense.  
Quick heads-up: Lara tossed me a new curveball today—an Equities Licensing Invoices MIS dashboard that’s a bit higher profile. I’m not dropping Billing Cycle (love that one!), but I might need to ease up the pace a tad to juggle both. The first UAT cut I’d hoped for by early April (around the 7th) might slide a little—maybe mid-April now, depending on how Equities shapes up. Cool with you? I’ll know more after chatting with Lara next week and can keep you posted.  
Looking forward to Tuesday—any prep I should do?

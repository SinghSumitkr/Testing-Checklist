Throughout the year, I have consistently gone above and beyond the core responsibilities assigned to me. While the Jira tasks have been handled effectively and within the expected timeframes, I’ve ensured that my contributions extend far beyond what was outlined. My focus has always been on positioning the QlikView team ahead of its expectations, creating innovative solutions, and crafting results that not only meet the user’s needs but also anticipate challenges before they arise. Below, I’ll outline the efforts that reflect my dedication to delivering exceptional outcomes—efforts that are not tied directly to my Jira assignments but have played a crucial role in enhancing the team’s overall performance, user experience, and reputation:


1.	Driving Excellence Through Comprehensive Code and Interface Mastery: Going Beyond the Role to Ensure High-Quality Deliverables and Exceptional User Experience

I have ensured that there isn’t a single code script or dashboard interface developed by our team that I’m not fully aware of. I have a clear understanding of what code is written, where it's written, and for what purpose, along with the expected outcomes if alternate code were used. I can assess the performance of the current code versus alternative options and see how different sections of code leverage each other. While this level of involvement isn’t officially part of my role, I have immersed myself in everything related to our code—whether it’s the MD pricing, Mansat, or FFX projects, or code written by any team member like Manas or Praveen.
I’m extensively involved in each project, continuously sharing best practices with the team. I offer guidance on maintaining the most efficient code structures, ensuring our code is dynamic, robust, and optimized for performance. I bring the same level of attention to dashboard interface development—understanding how each property impacts the overall user experience and making adjustments to enhance features and align with our templates.
While this goes beyond my formal job duties, I see it as a step toward leadership. My goal is to ensure that both backend and frontend development follow best practices, resulting in high-quality products that deliver an exceptional user experience. I’m committed to moving the team forward with extra effort in every aspect of our deliverables, ensuring we exceed expectations at every step.

2.	Innovative Problem-Solving and Leadership in Overcoming Data Access Challenges During Qlik Sense Migration

Since we started the Qlik Sense migration, we’ve faced several challenges, primarily due to the infrastructure shift from our in-house QlikView environment and on-prem GOS DB to AWS. One major roadblock has been the restriction on accessing production data—no one is authorized to access it in this new setup. This posed a significant issue: without access to actual production data, how could we resolve potential ProdX issues in the future?
Rather than simply highlighting this limitation or complaining about the restrictions, I took the initiative to find a workaround. After one discussion, I spent several days developing a non-conventional method to access the production data, which was crucial for us to maintain the ability to troubleshoot and fix any future issues. While the first version of this solution may not be perfect, it’s a step forward and something I’m confident the team will rely on.
I plan to refine it further, making it more robust and scalable for broader use. This wasn’t a task assigned to me—there wasn’t a Jira ticket for it—but I saw the challenge as an opportunity to lead by example. I didn’t just accept the limitations; I created a solution that empowers the team to move forward and be prepared for any production issues that may arise. This effort demonstrates leadership, showing that sometimes going beyond the expected is necessary to benefit the entire team.

3.	Proactive Solution Development to Prevent Dashboard Failures and Enhance Data Handling

On realizing about an error in the data reconciliation dashboard's production refresh, I investigated and realized that the error was due to a data issue, so it needed to be handled by the Data team. Technically, I could have stopped there after informing them, but I didn’t. Instead, I proposed and developed an alternate solution that would prevent the dashboard from failing in similar situations in the future and also notify stakeholders about the specific data issue.
Currently, whenever a data issue arises, the dashboard fails until the root cause is manually identified and corrected, which takes time and resources. My solution would ensure that the dashboard doesn't fail, but instead skips over the problematic data, highlights it in a separate report, and notifies the user of the exact data point that needs to be fixed. This would save significant resources by automating the error identification process, eliminating the need for manual analysis, and ensuring the dashboard continues running smoothly.
While you initially didn’t agree with the solution and CCS also opted for a temporary fix, I went ahead and built it anyway. The queries I created would filter out error data in the backend, display the discrepancies, and ensure the dashboard continued functioning without being impacted by faulty data. Unfortunately, the i-drive disaster in Singapore wiped out the work, but the effort I put in was immense. I believed in this solution, despite initial pushback from you, and I took it upon myself to create something that would benefit the team in the long run. 

4.	Taking Initiative to Resolve Performance Issues and Drive Cross-Team Collaboration

We identified a performance issue with the equity licensing extraction when connecting to the AWS data source, particularly with the LDR table, which was taking significantly longer than in the GOS DB extract. While we discussed the need to explore this further and find the root cause of the issue and explore the potential solution for that, I didn’t wait for a JIRA ticket or for the issue to escalate with larger products.
I proactively reached out to the person who could provide insight, explained the problem in detail—not just for my area but also for Mansart—and involved Manas in the conversation. I gathered all relevant information, identifying GTI and AWS teams as key players in resolving the issue. I discussed possible alternatives for the AWS structure with Prabhat, and for the GTI side, I drafted a detailed email outlining the problem, expectations, and requested their input on improving performance.
I didn’t take these steps because it was assigned to me or because my manager asked me to. I acted because I recognized the need to step forward without waiting for a formal task. This initiative is what true leadership is about—not waiting for something to land on your plate, but addressing problems as they arise and pushing for solutions.

5.	Supporting AI/ML initiative: Proactively Supporting Data Preparation and Cross-Team Collaboration

I take great pride in the effort I've dedicated to our AI/ML initiatives. When I first learned that an ML solution was to be developed for FFX, FMI, and Equities, and our ExCapp team was tasked with providing sample datasets for these products, I immediately connected with the product owners—Saurabh, Sophie, and Stuart—on multiple occasions to refine extract queries suitable for the ML solution. I then pulled and shared sample data for all three products with Ajinkya, followed up on his assessment, and ensured the data was sufficient for ML development. After receiving confirmation for FFX, I extracted 13 months of data, stored it in a shared location, and coordinated access.
Beyond that, I connected with the ML development team to fully understand their requirements—whether they needed more fields, if they had access issues, or if they required additional input from the product owners. I stayed deeply involved, organizing recurring meetings to address roadblocks and pulling in Sourav when Ajinkya needed help with business understanding. Although I wasn’t formally assigned this task, I invested significant time and effort, ensuring nothing slipped through the cracks.
Even when Sanath advised me to hand off this project to Gemma, I couldn’t just walk away. Despite having no formal obligation, I remained committed, continuing to work with Ajinkya, Gemma, and Sourav to identify additional fields to reconcile FFX data with GL data, and to repeat the process for FMI. None of this was done with my leads’ knowledge, yet I persist.

6.	Revolutionizing Reconciliation Extract: Identifying and Resolving Performance Bottlenecks Beyond the Scope

When I was assigned a JIRA to revamp the reconciliation dashboard, focusing on script-level work to limit ExCapp data and retain only broker data in the model, as well as completely restructuring the management overview, I quickly realized there was a major, unaddressed pain point—the query performance of the reconciliation extract. The query, which was supposed to pull 100 delta IDs, was taking over 4.5 hours to complete, and it still frequently failed due to timeout issues. This failure led to users reporting outdated data, as the dashboard hadn’t shown anything beyond January 2024 for months.
The challenge around this issue was twofold: a massive backlog of over six months of data and the extraction query's poor performance, which could never clear this backlog. The query was processing only 100 delta IDs per execution, and even then, it had been failing for the past 15 days, worsening the situation. It became clear that with the current performance, clearing the backlog was nearly impossible.
I immediately took action, first attempting to implement parallel processes like the one used in Cost+ EMEA, but that approach didn’t yield the desired results. I experimented with various permutations and combinations, but nothing seemed to work. Finally, I dove deep into the query, isolating the section that was causing the delay. I discovered unnecessary fields and a problematic join between the reconciliation and broker results, which couldn’t be removed but was essential to the dashboard’s purpose of reconciling broker data.
To address this, I split the query into smaller segments, fine-tuned it, and—much to my delight—saw an immediate improvement. What once took over 4.5 hours was now accomplished in just a minute. With the optimization in place, I increased the batch size to 500 delta IDs to tackle the backlog more efficiently, and within 20 minutes, the entire backlog of six months was cleared.
This was a major breakthrough, a performance optimization that had a huge impact. And notably, all of this was done within the original JIRA, which was solely meant for revamping the dashboard interface. No one had flagged this query performance issue, and no additional JIRA or directive was given to address it. This was my first time working on the reconciliation dashboard, and I took the initiative to identify the problem, solve it, and implement the solution—going above and beyond the assigned scope.

7.	Driving User-Centered Innovation: Redesigning the Qlik Sense Interface and Enhancing User Experience

Another key achievement was the redesign of the User Interface for the newly migrated Qlik Sense dashboard. From the moment I first saw the initial version, I voiced my concern that the interface lacked the professionalism and visual appeal necessary for user acceptance. I was convinced that it would either be poorly received or outright rejected by the users. As a developer, I understand the challenges and limitations involved in creating such interfaces, yet even I found it unappealing. If it couldn’t win me over, how could we expect end users—who are less familiar with the development challenges—to appreciate or engage with it?
Initially, my push to redesign the dashboard was sidelined due to concerns that Vizlib extensions, which could elevate the design, were deemed unreliable for our solution. I continued to raise this issue periodically, knowing that a poorly designed interface would impact user experience and diminish the overall perception of ExCapp's deliverables. Eventually, my persistence paid off when Jen proposed a new interface requirement. This gave the redesign effort the traction it needed, and we began revamping the dashboard interface. The final product was radically different from the initial design, delivering an interface that significantly enhanced user appeal, experience, and established a strong brand presence for ExCapp solutions.
While I won’t claim full credit for the new user interface—it was a collaborative effort—I take pride in being the driving force behind the push for change. I recognized early on how important the user experience would be, and hence was constantly advocating to work for more professional interface.
Following the release of the new interface, I also took the initiative to create a comprehensive user guide to ensure that end users could navigate and leverage the dashboard effectively. Initially, there were objections to the way I was drafting this documentation. However, after explaining my approach and why certain elements were essential, I received your agreement. Though I was originally allotted just one day to complete the guide, we know the level of detail and clarity it has brought in the final version would take at least three days. This attention to detail was not just about creating a user manual—it was about building user efficiency and reinforcing ExCapp’s brand.

8.	Proactive Optimization: Enhancing Threshold Alert Reporting and Streamlining Process Efficiency

Another notable contribution I proactively undertook to improve ExCapp’s deliverables was the optimization of the Threshold Alert Reporting process. I identified the need for this enhancement and immediately recognized that it couldn't wait to be slotted into our already over-committed capacity for the upcoming months. Without waiting for a JIRA assignment, I took ownership, initiated the work, optimized the extraction query, and conducted thorough testing in the UAT environment. The results were highly encouraging—reflecting a significant 70-80% performance improvement.
I meticulously validated the data before and after the optimization to ensure accuracy, documenting everything as evidence to support the changes I made. I released the optimization into production, and the impact was remarkable. What used to take 3.5 hours in production now executes in as little as 35 minutes to 1 hour 10 minutes, showcasing a clear 3x improvement in performance and a 75% reduction in processing time.
This wasn’t just about optimizing a critical process; I took the initiative to ensure that even non-critical processes were optimized to prevent any unnecessary delays that could escalate into significant issues. In the past, we faced concerns regarding qvw task failing to complete on time, causing N-Printing reports to pick up data from the previous day. To mitigate this, we synchronized the execution schedules with enough buffer time between the completion of the task and the triggering of the N-Printing process. However, due to dependency on other systems, the overall process was delivering reports at the last possible moment of the business day.
With my optimization, we can now safely deliver these reports two hours earlier, significantly reducing the risk of failures and ensuring timelier reporting. This not only addresses past concerns but also avoids rare situations where QlikView refreshes might delay report generation.
I highlight this work because it demonstrates my proactive approach to problem-solving and delivering impactful results without waiting for a formal assignment. This was a deliberate step forward in enhancing both critical and non-critical processes, ensuring smoother operations and improved efficiency across the board.

9.	Pioneering a Future-Proof Solution: Optimizing Dashboard Performance for Enhanced User Experience

One instance that truly stands out is when I proposed a solution that would significantly transform our dashboard’s response time. After returning from my leave, I noticed ongoing discussions about improving the user access experience on our dashboards. Although I was keen to contribute, I was initially excluded from these conversations. Eventually, Sanath encouraged me to join the meetings, but when I requested to be included, I was asked to step away on your instruction, which meant I couldn’t actively participate.
However, during a later meeting between you, Manas, and me, you explained the CCS team’s concerns. In that same meeting, I proposed a solution that would not only address the performance issue but also ensure that we preserved all data and dashboard components. Later, I built a simulated solution in Excel that maintained the familiar look and feel of our dashboards. I presented this prototype internally and even to the CCS users, even though it wasn’t officially considered the next step.
Despite not receiving immediate buy-in, I believed strongly in the potential of my solution. I continued working on it offline, aggregating data after the transformation stage and applying that to all visualization sheets, except for self-service reporting, which I kept pulling from the transformed data. This approach allowed me to maintain the dashboard’s functionality while optimizing performance, especially for users not involved in granular analysis. Unfortunately, due to a loss of our I-drive, the prototype was lost, along with several other initiatives I had been working on.
Nevertheless, I still firmly believe that this solution will become necessary in the future, especially as we migrate to larger products. Currently, we are already experiencing delays in smaller products like EQL, Monsart, and RBL in Qlik Sense as the solution is hosted on enterprise servers. These delays will likely increase with more complex data models. If we don’t segregate granular data from the main data model, the user experience will suffer, and performance concerns will escalate.
Had my prototype not been lost, I could have quickly replicated it in Qlik Sense, but my effort wasn’t in vain. The tests I conducted on my local environment were incredibly satisfying—the dashboard responded much faster, and the self-service reporting was separated to minimize impact on the majority of users who don’t require deep data analysis. While this solution hasn’t been prioritized yet, I’m confident it is the key to ensuring smooth performance for our Qlik Sense dashboards. Given the inherent delays we’re experiencing with the Qlik Sense enterprise server, implementing this would ensure that users who don’t need self-service reporting won’t be burdened by unnecessary performance issues.
I remain convinced that this solution will be the way forward to ensure optimal user experience and efficiency in our dashboard environment.

10.	Proactive System Optimization: Elevating Standards Beyond Assigned Tasks

I want to highlight another instance that demonstrates my proactive approach to maintaining the highest standards in our system. When something is out of alignment with our standards, I don’t wait for a JIRA to be assigned or for instructions to come my way. If the issue can be resolved with low to medium effort, I take the initiative to fix it and then inform you—my focus is on resolving the issue, not waiting for formal directives.
In one such discussion, we were reviewing the Mansart Transformation QVW script and noticed it wasn’t optimized. The team member handling the issue didn’t have the bandwidth or the deeper understanding of why the script was written that way, and what improvements could be made. Since I originally created the Mansart scripting, I knew I was the right person to optimize it. While helping Praveen with a different ticket—where he needed clarity on implementing logic for dashboard fixes—I saw this as the perfect opportunity to go beyond just solving his immediate issue. I took the file, wrote the necessary logic, and also addressed the non-standard aspects of the data model, transforming it into a more standardized and optimized version.
I could have simply focused on Praveen’s request and ignored the larger issue, but I extended my involvement beyond what was expected. This was done entirely on my own initiative, without being asked or having it assigned in JIRA. This demonstrates my commitment to the team and the project—any loose ends on the dashboard side are part of my responsibility, and I believe in fixing them today rather than waiting for tomorrow. If something needs attention and I can address it, I do so without hesitation.


11.	Enhancing Process Efficiency with Incremental Transformation Logic

I want to highlight another instance where I proactively addressed a complex issue that impacted the team’s deliverables. The team identified that the Cost Plus NA transform was failing from some time, hence a resolution JIRA was created and assigned to Gaurav. After initial analysis, Gaurav reached out to me, noting some missing components in the solution that could be the reason behind the script running for over four and a half hours before failing. We realized that the Cost Plus NA transform lacked incremental logic, meaning the entire dataset was being processed each time. As the data volume grew, this caused excessive processing time, leading to failures when the threshold timeline was exceeded.
We quickly identified that by transforming only the delta data, rather than the entire dataset, the workload would be much lighter, significantly improving processing times. The transformed data would then append to the previously transformed data, keeping the process efficient. To implement this, we needed to add incremental logic into the transformation layer, which required careful consideration of how to write the code.
I worked closely with Gaurav to build the logic. However, a challenge arose when some fields were dynamically generated in the query during the transformation layer. These fields were later referenced in the script, but in the UAT environment, due to limited data, the dynamic fields weren’t being created, causing the solution to fail. Although the solution couldn’t be fully tested in UAT and, therefore, couldn’t be pushed to production, we had already made significant progress. The only remaining task was a small piece of query work to conditionally manage these dynamic fields within the script.
What I want to emphasize here is the time and effort I dedicated to improve the logic and introducing the incremental transformation concept. While the final piece is pending, I’m confident that with a little more time, I can resolve it quickly. This effort, alongside the tasks I am officially responsible for, demonstrates my commitment to going above and beyond to ensure the success of the team. These additional tasks often require significant time investment, but I am always ready to take them on to improve the overall process.

12.	Streamlining Data Processing: Proactive Logic Refinement for Enhanced Efficiency

I want to highlight an instance that showcases how I continuously refine and enhance the logic I develop. The core idea behind my work is simple: what works today can always be improved tomorrow, and I strive to find opportunities to optimize, innovate, and evolve. One such example is a piece of logic I revisited—logic that was functioning perfectly fine but could still be improved for performance and efficiency.
Initially, when pulling data from Aurora into Qlik and storing records into Qlik variables, I was using a straightforward approach. We were passing variables into the WHERE clause for respective fields, but the challenge arose because, instead of passing a combination of data, we were passing individual values as lists. This meant that random combinations could be pulled, which, in turn, resulted in unneeded records being loaded into memory. Then we use an inner join to filter out the unneeded data after it was loaded into memory. 
When Gaurav was implementing the MD Processing, I saw an opportunity to improve this logic. I realized that we didn’t need to perform the inner join at all. The issue wasn’t that the inner join was having any concern—the issue was those unnecessary data which was getting loaded into memory in the first place. So, I decided to implement a new logic to filter out unwanted data before it even reached the memory, using a simple yet effective "EXIST-NOT EXIST" approach. This allowed us to prevent unnecessary data from entering memory in the first place, streamlining the process and improving performance.
Even though the original logic was working fine without causing any performance issues, this change made the system more efficient by ensuring that memory was reserved only for relevant data. It’s a small shift, but one that aligns with my continuous commitment to refining my work and finding more efficient solutions. The result? A cleaner, faster process that performs even better than before, without compromising on the accuracy or quality of the data.



My contributions throughout the year extend far beyond these 12 key incidents where I deeply invested my time and energy away from the assigned JIRA tickets, leading to successful or partially successful outcomes. There have been countless smaller efforts and many failed attempts as well, all of which have kept me fully engaged in enhancing the overall impact of our team. Some of the more challenging projects where I didn’t achieve the desired success include:
•	Attempting to build an ML model using data provided by Lakshmi to identify missing rate codes, which could have theoretically improved reconciliation throughput.
•	Exploring every possible avenue to automate Sherlock reports generated during the first three days of each month. I experimented with Python scripts and RPA tools to find a solution.
•	Trying to create a universal tool that would automatically migrate load scripts from QlikView to Qlik Sense.
•	Tackling the FFX data to either fix missing information or highlight discrepancies early using an ML solution, with the goal of improving the overall reconciliation rate.

These are significant efforts I plan to revisit next year, as they have the potential to greatly reduce manual effort and streamline our daily work. In addition, there were several smaller but time-consuming tasks, such as:
•	Creating the timeline for Qlik Sense migration.
•	Drafting dashboard interface design guidelines on Confluence.

Let’s also not overlook my consistent involvement in supporting the team, especially stepping in to ensure resolutions are achieved on numerous occasions. 

Lastly, I’d like to spotlight a deliverable that continues to make a substantial impact: the BD1 optimization of the Cost+ EMEA QlikView process. This work continues to provide significant benefits, though completed last year, promised at the start of this year to be considered during the 2024 assessment.

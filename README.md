I wanted to share a quick rundown on the Athena Reporting Tool (ART), an in-house platform we discussed today, to get your take on how it might fit with our Xcap reporting needs—or if we should stick with our current setup. Here’s what I’ve gathered so far:  
What ART Does:  
Self-Service Reporting: It’s a web app where users log in, build reports, run them, and set schedules—all on their own. Built with React and Node.js, it runs on JPMorgan’s GAIA system.  

Two Main Features:  
Reports: Users pick columns, add filters (like “Book” for specific data), sort, group, and format results like in Excel. Reports can run on-demand or be scheduled (time- or event-based) and emailed out (zipped if big).  

Raw Data Pulls: Has a query section to grab detailed data from tables in one data source, including joins—think quick ‘poke reports.’

Automation: Teams can set email lists for report delivery; a scheduler scans and runs jobs automatically.  

Monitoring: Shows report status, errors, and lets you retry or download results—all in a dashboard.  

Tech Details: Heavy lifting’s in the backend (Athena-driven REST APIs, JSON configs in Hydra), with a light front-end UI.

Why It’s Interesting:  
Matches a lot of what Ops wants: one tool to pull raw Xcap data and crank out billing reports, with automation baked in. Could cut down on juggling multiple systems—users do it all in one spot.

Potential Concerns:  
Athena Tie-In: It’s built for Athena, JPMorgan’s data platform. Xcap’s not on Athena, so copying ART means a big rebuild—new backend, new integrations. That’s time and money we’d need to weigh.  

Performance Trade-Off: Decent at both data pulls and reports, but not the fastest for raw queries (SQL Workbench beats it there) or the sharpest for polished outputs (our Reporting Tool’s templates are slicker).

Our Current Plan (for Comparison):  
Two Tools: SQL Workbench (then a free in-house tool in Q2) for fast data pulls, and our Reporting Tool for report templates and automation. Costs $5/TB now, free soon—no big rebuild needed.

I’m curious what you think—could ART’s all-in-one vibe work for Xcap if we tweak it, or does our two-tool split still make more sense? I’d love to chat 15-20 minutes to get your take (and some feedback on my VP push too!). Let me know when you’re free!
